- [ ] Store extracted metadata in the database
- [ ] Update media scanning service to use advanced extraction

---

### Frontend

#### 1. UI Redesign

- [ ] Redesign media list view with better layout
- [ ] Implement search and filter functionality
- [ ] Add media detail view with metadata display

#### 2. Video Playback Improvements

- [ ] Improve video player controls and UI
- [ ] Support for additional video formats

## Technical Decisions

### 1. SQLite for Database

SQLite is chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration into the existing architecture. It provides sufficient capabilities for the current scale of media management. In future versions, support for changing to the user's choice of database, such as Postgres, can be considered.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk   | Impact   | Mitigation   |
| ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Database integration issues | High | Thorough testing and gradual migration of data |
| UI redesign complexity | Medium | User feedback sessions and iterative design process |
